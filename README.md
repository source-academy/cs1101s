# CS1101S Questions Repository

Dear Cadets, do you have any burning, conceptual questions about the module content? Or, are you up for the challenge to answer such questions posed by your fellow cadets? If yes, we have something for you! 

We’re launching a [repository](https://github.com/source-academy/cs1101s/), where we want to collect conceptual questions about the content and provide the best possible answers. **CS1101S staff** will monitor the repository and answer questions or verify other answers. 

In this way, we can create a question-answer bank that will help students revise and practice for your upcoming assessments. 

Note that participation in this is **completely voluntary** and you will need **a GitHub account** to participate. 

*How to post a question?*

Go to the repository and **open an issue** for each question that you have (please search the issues to check if the question doesn't already exist to avoid duplicates). Please include the main question in the title of the issue and include any more information in the comment section. You may use markdown to format your posts and here's a [nice cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for that. 

You can read more about opening issues [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue). You can review a sample question posted in the issues tab for your reference. 

*What is a “conceptual” question?*

Conceptual questions are high-level questions that are related to understanding of the material (as against applying the material). For example, “how does tail recursion work” is a conceptual question, but “how to implement tail recession for fibonacci” (because the answer to this question will have some implementation of the fibonacci function). 

If you're unsure about whether or not a question is 'conceptual', don't worry - post it anyways. We will let you know whether or not it is a 'conceptual question'. Please don't be affraid of posting questions! 

*How to answer a question?*

Simply go to the issues tab in this repository and select a question based on the title. If you want to answer, simply respond to the issue with your explanation. You may use markdown to format your answers as well. Use the terminology of the textbook and lectures.

If you have any more questions, please let us know via piazza or by raising it to any of the staff members.
